\v 40 I will reply, 'The truth is that whatever you did for any one of your fellow believers, even the most unimportant one, you certainly did it for me.'
\p
\v 41 But then I will say to those on my left, 'You people whom God has cursed, leave me! Go into the eternal fire that God has prepared for the devil and his angels!
\v 42 It is right for you to go there, because you did not give me anything to eat when I was hungry. You did not give me anything to drink when I was thirsty.
\v 43 You did not invite me into your homes when I was a stranger in your town. You did not give me any clothes when I needed them. You did not take care of me when I was sick or in prison.'

\v 40 And the King will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you, what you did for one of the least of my brothers here, you did it for me.'
\v 41 Then he will say to those on his left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for
the devil and his angels,
\v 42 because I was hungry but you did not give me food; I was thirsty but you did not give me a  drink;
\v 43 I was a stranger but you did not take me in; naked but you did not clothe me; sick and in prison, but you did not care for me.'
