day of their destruction; do not boast in the day of their distress.
\v 13 Do not enter my people's gate in the day of their calamity; do not gloat over their affliction in the day of
their disaster, do not loot their wealth in the day of their ruin.
\v 14 And do not stand at the crossroads, to cut off his fugitives; and do not hand over his survivors in the day of distress.
