===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Obadiah his message to Edom.
    * **your alliance** - The word "your" refers to the nation of Edom.
    * **will send you on your way to the border** - "will send you out of their land." The people of Edom will try to take refuge in the land of their allies, but their allies will not let the people of Edom stay in their land.
    * 
    * **men of your alliance** - "men of your partnership" or AT: "your partners"
  * **prevailed against you** - "have overcome you" or  "have conquered you"
  * **There is no understanding in him** - Here, "him" refers to those who humble Edom.
  * **understanding** - "reason" or "wisdom"
  * **and understanding out of the mountain of Esau? - **  Obadiah is not really expecting an answer here. (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
  * **mountain of Esau** - The "mountain of Esau" is another way to say the "land of Edom." (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **your mighty men will be dismayed, Teman** - "Teman" was a descendant of Esau. This is just another way to refer to the people of Edom. (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **your mighty men will be dismayed** - AT: "these things will discourage your strong men" or "these things will terrify your strong men" (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
