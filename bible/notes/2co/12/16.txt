\v 16 \add You all\add* know that I did not depend on you \add to provide for my needs\add*. However, \add there are some who accuse me, saying that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* I was very clever and got money from you by tricking you.
\v 17 But did I ever do that? No! I never \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* asked any of the men whom I sent to you \add to get money\add* from you \add and bring it to me\add*!
\v 18 Titus went \add and visited you because\add* I urged him to do so. I also sent the other believer, \add whom you know\add*, to go with Titus. \add You know that\add* Titus did not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* trick \add you in order to get money from you. And you certainly know that\add* he and I have always \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* acted in exactly the same \add honest\add* way \add towards you\add*.

\v 16 And so, someone might say that although I did not ask you for money, I tricked you into letting me myself pay for everything I needed.
\v 17 Well, I never cheated you by using someone else I sent to you, did I?
\v 18 For example, I sent Titus and the other brother to you, but they did not ask you to support them, did they? Titus never made you pay his expenses, did he? Titus and the other brother treated you the same as I did, is this not so? We lived our lives in the same way; you never had to pay anything for us.

\v 16 But as it is, I did not burden you, but, since I am so crafty, I am the one who caught you by deceit.
\v 17 Did I take advantage of you by anyone I sent to you?
\v 18 I urged Titus to go to you, and I sent the other brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same way? Did we not take the same steps?
