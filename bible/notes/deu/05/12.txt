\v 12 Do not forget that the seventh day \add of every week\add* is mine and dedicate those days to me just like I, Yahweh your God, am commanding you.

\v 13 There are six days each week for you to do all your work,
\v 14 but the seventh day is a rest day, a day dedicated to me, Yahweh your God. On that day you must not do any work. You and your sons and daughters and your male and female slaves must not work. You must not even force your livestock to work, and you must not tell foreigners to work, those who are living in your country. You must allow your slaves to rest on that day just like you do.

\p
\v 12 Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy, as Yahweh your God commanded you.
\v 13 For six days you will labor and do all your work;
\v 14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God. In it you will not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servants nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle, nor any foreigner who is within your gates. This is so that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.
