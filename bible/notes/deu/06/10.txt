\v 10 When Yahweh your God brings you into the land that he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, toIsaac, and to Jacob, that he would give you, with large and very good cities that you did not build,
\v 11 and houses full of all kinds of good things that you did not make, cisterns that you did not dig, and vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant, you will eat and be satisfiedâ€”
\v 12 then be careful so that you do not forget Yahweh, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
