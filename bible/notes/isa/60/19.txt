===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

    * **Your sun will no longer set, nor will your moon withdraw and disappear** - Here "your sun" and "your moon" do not refer to the literal sun and moon. It refers to the light of Yahweh. This means God's presence and blessing will always be with them. AT: "Your sun and moon will always shine" (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
