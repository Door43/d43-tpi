===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he will be exalted and lifted high, and will be very exalted**  - The words "exalted" and "lifted high" and "very exhalted" mean basically the same thing and being repeated three times shows a great intensity of expression. AT for one single expression could be: "I will give my servant the greatest honor" (See the way you translated something similar in 6:1; 33:10 and 57:15.) (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]] and [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **horrified at you**  - Here "you" refers to Yahweh's servant. (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of You]])
  * **his appearance was so disfigured from human appearance, so that his form was far from the sons of humanity**  - AT: "His enemies beat his body so badly that he did not even look like a human anymore"
