This means God will greatly honor his servant because of his sacrifice. (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]] and [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **because he poured out his soul to death**  - AT: "he willingly died" or "he exposed himself to death" (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * **and was numbered with the transgressors**  - AT: "and allowed people to treat him as a criminal" (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors**  - The word "intercession" here means the servant pleaded or prayed to Yahweh on behalf of sinners.
