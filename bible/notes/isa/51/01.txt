===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:tpi:obe:kt:righteous]]
  * [[:tpi:obe:kt:yahweh]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Listen to me**  - Here "me" is Yahweh.
  * **look at the rock from which you were chiseled, and to the quarry from which you were cut**  - Both phrases mean basically the same thing. This refers to a person cutting out smaller stones from a large rock to use for building. God compares this to Abraham and Sarah through whom he made the nation of Israel. AT: "Think about your ancestors who are like the rock from which I chiseled you and made you a nation."
