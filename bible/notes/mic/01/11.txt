===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Pass by, inhabitants of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame **-Micah is again using word play to illustrate his disappointment. The Name Shaphir translates as “to be pleasing,” so a possible AT: Once pleasing people of Shaphir, pass by in your nakedness and shame. (see:[[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])
  * **The inhabitants of Zaanan do not come out **  - Micah’s word play continues with the city named Zaanan, which translates as “go out.” Here a Micah is trying to show that the impending doom is so great, that those known for going out should rather stay in.
  * **Beth Ezel mourns for their protection is taken away - **  (see: [[:tpi:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **The inhabitants of Maroth wait anxiously for good news **  -
