\v 10 The young men who had grown up with Rehoboam spoke to him, saying, "Speak to these people who told you that your father Solomon  made their yoke heavy but that you must make it lighter. You should speak them, 'My little finger is thicker than my fatherâ€™s waist.
\v 11 So now, although my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scorpions.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.** - This is a rude saying suggesting that Rehoboam was stronger and more powerful than his father Solomon. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])   
    * **My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scorpions.**  - This means that the punishment Rehoboam plans to give will be worse than what his father gave. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
   * **I will punish you with scorpions** - Possible meanings of scorpion are 1) "a type of whip made with thorny prickles" or 2) "a spider-like creature that has a dangerous and painful sting"
