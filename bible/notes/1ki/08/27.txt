===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 But God, will you really live on the earth among people? There is not enough space in heaven for you to have enough space to live there. So this temple that I have commanded my workers to build is certainly too small for you to live in.
\v 28 But Yahweh, my God, please listen to me while I am praying to you this day,

\v 27 But will God actually live on the earth? Look, the entire universe and heaven itself cannot contain youâ€”how much less can this temple that I have built!
\v 28 Yet please respect this prayer of your servant and his request, Yahweh my God; listen to the cry and prayer that your servant prays before you today.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But will God actually live on the earth?** - Solomon uses this question to express wonder at the idea that God would live among people in a temple. AT: "God will not actually live on the earth!" (see [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this prayer of your servant and his request** - The words "prayer" and "request" mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) 
  * **listen to the cry and prayer that your servant prays** - This part of the sentence says the same thing as the first part in order to emphasize it. (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
