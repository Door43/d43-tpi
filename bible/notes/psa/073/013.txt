<usfm>
\q
\v 13 Surely it is in vain that I have guarded my heart
\q and washed my hands in innocence.
\q
\v 14 For all the day long have I been afflicted
\q and disciplined every morning.
\q
\v 15 If I had said, "I will say these things,"
\q then I would have betrayed this generation of your children.
