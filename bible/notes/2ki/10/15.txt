\v 15 When Jehu had left there, he met  Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him and
said to him, "Is your heart with me, as mine is with yours?" Jehonadab answered, "It is." Jehu said, "If it is, give me your hand." And Jehonadab gave him his hand, so Jehu took him up to him into the chariot.
\v 16 Jehu said, "Come with me and see my zeal for Yahweh." So he had Jehonadab ride in his chariot.
\v 17 When he came to Samaria, Jehu killed all who remained from Ahab's descendants in Samaria, until he had destroyed Ahab's royal line, just as was told them before by the word of Yahweh, which he had spoken to Elijah.
