\v 18 Then Jehu summoned all the people \add of Samaria\add*, and said to them, "King Ahab was devoted to \add your god\add* Baal a little bit, but I will serve him much more.
\v 19 So now summon all the prophets of Baal, all of Baal's priests, and all the others who worship Baal. I am going to make a great sacrifice to Baal. I want all of them to be there. Any of them who is not there will be executed." But Jehu was planning to trick them; he was planning to kill all those who worshiped Baal.
\p
\v 20 Then Jehu commanded, "Announce that we are going to set aside a day to honor Baal." So they did that.

\v 18 Then Jehu gathered all the people together and said to them, "Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him much.
\v 19 Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers, and all his priests. Let no one be left out, for I
have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal. Whoever does not come will not live." But Jehu did this deceitfully, with the intent to  kill the worshipers of Baal.
\v 20 Jehu said, "Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal, and set aside a day for it." So they proclaimed it.
