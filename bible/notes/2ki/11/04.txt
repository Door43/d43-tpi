\v 4 In the seventh year, Jehoiada sent messages and brought the commanders of hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought
them to himself, into the temple of Yahweh. He made a covenant with them, and he made them swear an oath in the house of Yahweh. Then he showed them the king’s son.
\v 5 He commanded them, saying, "This is what you must do. A third of you who come on the Sabbath will 
keep watch over the king’s house, 
\v 6 and a third will be at the Sur Gate, and a third at the gate behind the guardhouse."
