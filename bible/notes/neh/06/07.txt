===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **There is a king in Judah** - Sanballat says that Nehemiah has spread the idea that he will be the king of Judah.  
    * **You can be sure the king will hear these reports** - Here "the king" refers to Artaxerxes, the Persian king whom Nehemiah served as cupbearer.
    * **let us take counsel together** - This is a very soft, gentle wording from Sanballat to Nehemiah. When you translate this into your language, try to choose words that reflect the gentle wording.
