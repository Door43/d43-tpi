====== Hosea 04:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 It is because my people do not know \add about me\add* that they will be destroyed.
\q1 And their not knowing about me is because you have refused \add to teach them about me\add*;
\q2 so I will no longer allow you to be my priests.
\q1 You have forgotten the things that I taught you,
\q2 so I will forget \add to bless\add* your children.
\q1
\v 7 As there are more and more priests,
\q2 they have sinned against me more and more.
\q1 So I will no longer allow them to be honored;
\q2 instead, I will cause them to be disgraced.
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 You, my people, are perishing because they do not know me.
\q1 And why do you know me so little? Because you have rejected what you can know about me,
\q2 so I am rejecting you from being priests to me. 
\q1 Look what you have forgotten: You have forgotten the Law that I, your God, gave to you.
\q2 Because you forgot me, I will forget your children.
\q1
\v 7 The more numerous you priests become,
\q2 the more you do what I have forbidden.
\q2 
\q1 Everyone respects you now, but I will make them dishonor you.


\q1

\q
\v 6 My people are being destroyed for lack of knowledge.
\q Because you have rejected knowledge,
\q I will also reject you as priests to me.
\q Because you have forgotten the Law of me, your God,
\q I also will forget your children.
\q
\v 7 The more the priests multiplied,
\q the more they sinned against me.
\q I will change their honor into shame.
