\v 9 The sins that the Israelite people have committed are as awful as \add what the men of\add* Gibeah did long ago;

\q
\v 8 The prophet who is with my God is the watchman for Ephraim,
\q but a birdâ€™s snare is in  all of his paths,
\q and hostility toward him is in the house of his God.

\q as in the days of Gibeah.
\q God will call to mind their iniquity,
\q and he will punish their sins.
