\v 2 Yahweh also said to me, "I want you to accuse Israel, who is like a mother to you, of being like an unfaithful wife to me.
\q1 This nation is no longer like a wife to me,
\q2 and I am no longer like a husband to her.
\q1 Tell Israel that they must stop acting like a prostitute; she must stop worshiping idols.
\q2 Israel must stop worshiping idols. She must stop acting like a woman who leaves her husband and goes to other men.
\q1
\v 3 If she does not stop, 
\q1 I will take her clothes off her and make her naked like she was when she was born.
\q2 I will make her like the barren wildernessâ€”dry and lifeless;
I will make her like a woman dying from thirst in the desert.
