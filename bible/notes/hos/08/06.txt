<usfm>
\v 6 The shame of it is that this idol came from Israel! A craftsman made it. 
\q1 It is only an idol; it cannot be the true and living God! 
\q2 I will ensure that some will smash it to bits.
\b
\q1
\v 7 This is because they people do useless things, so something terrible will destroy them.
\q2 Their grain standing in the fields will give no harvest.
\q1 And even if it does, foreign soldiers will eat everything it produces.

\q
\v 6 For this thing came from Israel;
\q a workman made it;
\q it is not God!
\q The calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces.
\q
\v 7 For the people sow the wind
\q and reap the whirlwind.
\q The standing grain has no heads;
\q it yields no flour.
\q If it does come to maturity,
\q foreigners will devour it.
