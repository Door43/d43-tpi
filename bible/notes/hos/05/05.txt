===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 \add It is as though\add* their being proud testifies \f + \ft personification \f* against them.
\q2 The sins that \add the people of\add* Israel have committed \add are like a heavy load that causes them\add* to stumble,
\q2 and \add the people of\add* Judah stumble with them.
\q1
\v 6 They will come to worship me, Yahweh,
\q2 bringing their herds of sheep and cattle,
\q1 but they will not \add be able to\add* find me
\q2 because I have abandoned them.
\q1
\v 7 They have abandoned me;
\q2 and their children do not belong to me \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\q1 So \add they will not be able to celebrate\add* their festivals at the new moons
\q2 because I will destroy them and \add the crops in\add* their fields.

<usfm>
\v 5 Israel is proud; because of this others know how guilty she is.
\q2 The sins that the people of Israel have committed are making them faithless to Yahweh.
\q2 Judah is becoming faithless, too.
\q1
\v 6 They are hoping to persuade Yahweh to have mercy on them.
\q2 They are coming to sacrifice sheep and cattle to him from their flocks and herds
\q1 But they will find that Yahweh will have no mercy on them
\q2 because he has stopped helping them; he is leaving them alone.
\q1
\v 7 They did not keep their promises to Yahweh.
\q2 and they have had children by foreign women.
\q1 So at the time of the new moon festivals, 
\q2 they will perish, together with their cultivated fields.
\b

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 5 The pride of Israel testifies against him;
\q so Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their guilt;
\q and Judah also will stumble with them.
\q
\v 6 They will go with their flocks and herds to seek Yahweh,
\q but they will not find him,
\q for he has withdrawn himself from them.
\q
\v 7 They were unfaithful to Yahweh,
\q for they have borne illegitimate children.
\q Now the new moon festivals will devour them with their fields.
