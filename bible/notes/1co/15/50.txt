===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 50 Now I say this, brothers and sisters, human beings who will die cannot obtain the things that God promises to give all those whom he rules. It is just as the things that die cannot become things that do not die.
\v 51 Look! I tell you something that God has hidden from us. Not all believers will die, but God will change all of us.
</usfm>

\v 50 Now this I say, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does perishable inherit imperishable.
\v 51 Look! I tell you a secret truth: We will not all die, but we will all be changed.
