===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **brought down**  - On the one hand it is an idiom for "ruined" (UDB) or "destroyed", but it also begins the metaphor of entering sheol which is always described as down. (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]] and [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **Her house**  - AT: "She" (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **Her house is on the road to sheol, it goes**  - AT: "Her destination is sheol; she is going down"
  * **the rooms of death**
 - This expression pictures the dead as lying in many different rooms in sheol. (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **is on the road to sheol, it goes down to the rooms of death**  - These two phrases basically mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize that the adulteress will be destroyed. (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
