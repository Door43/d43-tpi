===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **How long will you sleep ... rise from your sleep?** - These two lines are critical questions from the teacher and basically mean the same thing. They repeated to show a lazy person will sleep long. (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **"A little more sleep ... of the hands to rest"** - This are the answer the lazy person will probably give, but it is the teacher who gives this answer to mock the lazy person.
    * **A little more sleep, a little more slumber** - These two phrases are repeated to answer the two questions.
    * **folding of the hands to rest** - The idea is that folded hands do not hold a tool and work. AT: "closing of the eyes" or "turning over in bed" (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
    * **and your poverty will come** - AT: "because this is what you think, poverty will come"
    * **your poverty will come to you like a robber** - The sudden way you become poor is compared to how sudden a robber comes to steal your things. AT: "you will quickly become poor, just like a robber quickly steals everything you have" (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **your needs like an armed soldier** - AT: "and you will be attacked by a situation in which you will need a lot of things, just like an armed soldier would attack you"
    * **an armed soldier** - AT: "a soldier holding a weapon in his hand" or "a soldier who is ready for battle"
