===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The desire of the lazy kills him **- "desire" means "longing" and "wish for", this may refer to lovely things or objects.
  * **All day long he craves and craves more **- "craves" equals to "desire" and "longing." (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **but the one who does right gives and does not hold back**  - the latter action strengthens the former action negatively. (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
