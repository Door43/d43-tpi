===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **To do what is right and just** - "right" and "just" mean basically the same thing. They are both used to reinforce the concept of righteousness. (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **haughty eyes and a proud heart** - "haughty" and "proud" together reinforce the concept of a person being prideful. "Eyes" and "heart" are all associated with being human. (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:tpi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the lamp of the wicked** - their outward happiness, like a shining lamp, cause them to sin. (See: [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
