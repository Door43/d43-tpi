  * **Answer a fool and join in on his folly **- AT: "Answer a fool according to his folly." The clause with the same structure but opposite meaning appears in verse 4. (See: Apostrophe; Parallelism)
  * **Whoever sends a message by the hand of a fool cuts off his own feet and drink violence **- "cuts off his own feet' means "the sending is badly carried out", by his quick decision of sending off a fool, he has to swallow injury. (See: Idiom)
