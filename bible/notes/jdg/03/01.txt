\v 1-2 At that time there were still many people-groups in Canaan. Yahweh left there to test the Israelite people. But many of the Israelites in Canaan were ones who had not fought in any of the wars in Canaan. So Yahweh also left those people-groups in Canaan so that the descendants of those who had not fought in any of the wars might learn how to fight.
\v 3 \add This is a list of\add* the people-groups that Yahweh left there: The Philistines and their five leaders, the people living in the area near Sidon \add city\add*, the descendants of Canaan, and the descendants of Hiv who were living in the mountains of Lebanon between Baal-Hermon Mountain and Lebo-Hamath.
