===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Why do you listen to the men who say, 'See, David is seeking your harm?'**  - This is a [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]].   The sense here is that there is no evidence to believe that David is seeking Saul's harm and in fact there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary so it is ludicrous to believe otherwise.
