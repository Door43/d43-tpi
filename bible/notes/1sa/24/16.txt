===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **my son David**  - Saul, at this moment (apparently due to a change of heart), is looking at David like a son even though not biologically so.   See: [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]
    * **Saul lifted up his voice and wept** - Saul wept with a loud voice.  See the UDB also.
