===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **They led away their cattle**  - In modern English "cattle" usually means cows.  In the biblical sense, however, it can be a more generic term such as "livestock" and can include several species such as cows, sheep, goats.   See Joseph's advice to his brothers when they arrived with their sheep in Egypt in Genesis 46:34 and the accompanying translation notes in: [[en/bible/notes/gen/46/33]]
