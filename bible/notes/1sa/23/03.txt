===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?**  - This is a [[:tpi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]].   If afraid of the enemy at home then certainly they would be even more afraid to go and directly attack the enemy (the Philistines).
