\c 3
\p
\v 1 The child Samuel served Yahweh under Eli. Yahweh's word was rare in those days; there was no frequent prophetic vision.
\v 2 At that time, when Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see well, was lying down in his own bed, 
\v 3 The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down to sleep in the house of Yahweh, where the ark of God was.
\v 4 Yahweh called to Samuel, who said, "Here I am."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **shrine- The word 'shrine' is troubling in the UDB because, thought it technically fits, it is not used in other translations. Other better expressions are used. This word is tainted by common usage today referring to unholy places. Tabernacle is an accurate and good term.**
