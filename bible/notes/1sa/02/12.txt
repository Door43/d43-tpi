\p
\v 12 Now the sons of Eli were worthless men. They did not know Yahweh.
\v 13 The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered a sacrifice, the priestâ€™s servant would come with a three pronged fork in his hand, while
the meat was boiling.
\v 14 He would stick it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot. All that the fork brought up the priest would take
for himself. They did this in Shiloh with all the Israelites that came there.
