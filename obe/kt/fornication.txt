====== sexual immorality ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "sexual immorality" refers to sexual activity that takes place outside the marriage relationship of a man and a woman. This is against God's plan. Older English Bible versions call this "fornication."

  * This term can refer to any kind of sexual activity that is against God's will, including homosexual acts and pornography.
  * One type of sexual immorality is adultery, which is sexual activity specifically between a married person and someone who is not that person's spouse.
  * Another type of sexual immorality is "prostitution," which involves being paid to have sex with someone.
  * This term is also used figuratively to refer to Israel's unfaithfulness to God when they worshiped false gods.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "sexual immorality" could be translated as "immorality" as long as the correct meaning of the term is understood.
  * Other ways to translate this term could include, "wrong sexual acts" or "sex outside of marriage."
  * This term should be translated in a different way from the term "adultery."
  * The translation of this term's figurative uses should retain the literal term if possible since there is a common comparison in the Bible between unfaithfulness to God and unfaithfulness in the sexual relationship.
