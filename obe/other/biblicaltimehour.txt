====== biblical time: hour ======

===== Definition: =====

The term **hour**  is often used in the Bible to tell more specifically what time a certain event took place.

  * The Jews counted daylight hours starting at sunrise (around 6 a.m.). So for example, “the ninth hour” meant “around three in the afternoon.”
  * Nighttime hours were counted starting at sunset (around 6 p.m.). So for example, “the third hour of the night” meant “around nine in the evening” in our present-day system..
  * Since the time of sunrise and sunset varies, the time references will not correspond exactly to present-day times. So time expressions using hours could be translated with phrases such as “around nine” or “about six o'clock.” Some translations will prefer to add phrases like "in the evening" or "in the morning" or "in the afternoon" to make it clear what time of day is being talked about.
