How to translate units of volume in the Bible:

  - Keep the Bible term, spelling it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible. [See Transliterate]
  - An important reason for keeping the Bible terms is to show that the Bible is true and that people actually used these units of measure during that time period.
  - If it doesn't work to use the Bible term, then instead, state the equivalent amount using a unit of measure that is known.
  - These methods could be combined, using the Bible term, but then also giving the equivalent amount in the text or a note.

**measure** \\ 
Sometimes Hebrew simply uses a number without a unit for measuring volume, so the ULB and UDB supply the word "measure." 

  * "whenever anyone came to the grainery for twenty __measures__ of grain, there were only ten, and whenever someone came to the wine vat to draw out fifty __measures__ of wine, there were only twenty." [[en:bible:notes:hag:02:15|Haggai 2:16]].

Translation suggestions. Any of these could work: 
  - Simply use the number without a unit. \\
  - Use a generic word like "measure." \\ 
  - Use the name of an appropriate container, such as "basket" for grain and "jar" for wine. \\ 
  - Use an appropriate measure that you are already using in your translation.
