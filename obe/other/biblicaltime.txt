====== biblical time ======

===== Definition: =====

During Bible times, people often used calendars and ways of marking time that are different from modern methods. 

**hour** - Hours were not always counted from midnight, as is common today. They were sometimes counted from sundown. For more information, see [[:tpi:obe:other:biblicaltimehour]].

**watch** - This refers to a period of time at night during which a watchman or guard for a city would be on duty looking out for any threat from an enemy. For more information, see [[:tpi:obe:other:biblicaltimewatch]].

**day** - The Jews considered Sunday to be the first day of the week. The day began and ended at sundown. They also sometimes used the term "day" as a metaphor for a longer period of time. For more information, see [[:tpi:obe:other:biblicaltimeday]].

**week** - The Jews considered that the week began at sundown on Saturday and ended at sundown on the next Saturday.  They also sometimes used "week" as a metaphor for a group of seven periods of time. For more information, see [[:tpi:obe:other:biblicaltimeweek]].

**month** - The various people in the Bible referred to "lunar" months instead of modern "solar" months. That is, the month lasted for the 28-1/2 days it takes the moon to circle the earth. The date of the the first month also varied. For more information, see [[:tpi:obe:other:biblicaltimemonth]].

**year** - The people in the Bible used different starting dates when they counted years. These dates were often related to the reign of kings, or to other important events. For more information, see [[:tpi:obe:other:biblicaltimeyear]].
