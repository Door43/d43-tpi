====== biblical time: NOT FOR PUBLICATION======

===== Definition: =====

During Bible times, the methods for marking time and keeping calendars were often different from modern methods.

**hour** - The term "hour" is used to state what time of day something occurred or to explain how long an event lasted. In the Jewish system of counting time, nighttime hours are counted from sunset(6:00 pm)  to sunrise (6:00 am), and daytime hours are counted from sunrise (6:00 am) to sunset  (6:00 pm). For more information, see [[:tpi:obe:other:biblicaltimehour|biblical time: hour]].

**watch** - A "watch" was a period of time at night during which a watchman or guard for a city would be on duty looking out for any threat from an enemy. For more information, see [[:tpi:obe:other:biblicaltimewatch|biblical time: watch]].

**day** - For Jews, the day began and ended at sundown, a time period of 24 hours. The term "day" is also sometimes used figuratively to refer to a more general period of time as in "the day of Yahweh."  For more information, see [[:tpi:obe:other:biblicaltimeday|biblical time: day]].

**week** - In the Jewish system of counting time, the week begins at sunset on Saturday and ends at sunset on the following Saturday. The term "week" is also used in the Bible as a metaphor for a group of seven periods of time. For more information, see [[:tpi:obe:other:biblicaltimeweek|biblical time: week]].

**month** - In Bible times, people followed the lunar calendar, which counts each month as lasting the 29.5 days that it takes for the moon to go around the earth. According to the lunar calendar system, some years have 12 months and other years have 13 months. Because of this, in this system the "first month" is not always at the same time every year.  For more information, see [[:tpi:obe:other:biblicaltimemonth|biblical time: month]].

**year** - A year is calculated to be around 354 days in length according to the lunar calendar, or around 365 days according to the solar calendar. Sometimes the term "year" is used figuratively to refer to a general time period as in, "the year of our Lord." For more information, see [[:tpi:obe:other:biblicaltimeyear|biblical time: year]].
