  * **Judea** - This refers to the southern section of Israel, which was settled by the tribe of Judah. Some languages will prefer to say, "the region of Judea."
  * **has fallen asleep, and I must wake him.** - Translate this phrase with the normal words for "asleep" and "wake" in your language. Although Jesus was using these words with a different meaning, the disciples did not understand that yet.
