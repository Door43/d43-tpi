==== Translation Notes: ====

  * **garden**  - A special collection of trees and plants that God prepared for Adam and Eve to enjoy and from which to eat. This should be the same word that was used in **[[:tpi:obs:notes:frames:01-11|[01-11]]]**. See how you translated it there.
  * **talked with God**  - The word for "talk" should be the same as would be used to refer to talking to a human being. God may have taken a physical form to talk to the man and the woman since the text indicates that they talked to him face-to-face.
  * **shame**  - The feeling that comes with knowing we have sinned or that we fall short in some way.
