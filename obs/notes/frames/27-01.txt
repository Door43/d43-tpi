  * **to test him** - That is, "to see if Jesus would give a good answer."
  * **to inherit eternal life** - That is, "to have life with God forever" or, "so that God will give me life with him forever" or, "to receive eternal life from God." The law expert was asking how he could be worthy to receive eternal life as an inheritance from God the Father.
  * **eternal life** - This refers to life forever with God after the mortal body dies. See the key term page for eternal life.
  * **What is written in God's law?** - That is, "What is written in God's law about this?" Jesus asked this question because he wanted the man to think about what God's law really teaches.
