===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **place of worship** - That is, "the building where the Jewish people gathered to worship God." This can also be translated as "worship building." See how you translated it in **[[:tpi:obs:notes:frames:26-02|[26-02]]]**.
  * **But Jesus walked through the crowd** - "But" could be translated with a strong contrast word or phrase such as "But instead" or, "However" to show that the people were not able to do to Jesus what they had planned to do.
