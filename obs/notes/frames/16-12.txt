==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **horn** - This could be translated as, "trumpet" or, "ram's horn trumpet." These horns came from a male sheep and were often used to call men for battle.
  * **a torch** - This was probably a piece of wood wrapped with cloth and soaked in oil so that it could burn well. (This was not the modern torch that runs on batteries.)
