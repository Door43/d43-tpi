===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the Holy Spirit led him** - That is, "the Holy Spirit guided him" or, "the Holy Spirit prompted him to go."
  * **the wilderness** - This could also be translated as, "the desert" or, "a remote, barren place with few people." This place probably had very few trees or other plants, so most people would not be able to live there.
  * **forty days and forty nights** - This means "forty days, both during the day and during the night." Make sure the translation of this phrase does not sound like a period of eighty days.
  * **tempted him to sin** - Since Jesus did not sin, make sure you use a word that does not imply that Satan succeeded in convincing Jesus to sin. This phrase could also be translated as, "tried to convince him to sin."
