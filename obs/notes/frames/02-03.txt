===== Important Terms: =====


  * **[[:tpi:obe:kt:god]]**
  * **[[:tpi:obe:kt:good]]**
  * **[[:tpi:obe:kt:evil]]**
  * **[[:tpi:obe:kt:death]]**


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **fruit** - We don't know what kind of fruit this was. We only know that it grew on this tree. If possible it is best to use a general word for fruit here, and not a word for a specific kind of fruit.
  * **tree of the knowledge of good and evil** - The woman correctly understood that they were not allowed to eat from this one tree that would enable them to understand evil as well as good.
  * **you will die** - Use your ordinary word for death, for a person's physical life to end. Don't avoid the term just because the thought of death sounds too harsh.
