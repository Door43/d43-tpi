===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **wilderness** - That is, "the desert" or, "a remote, desert-like place." There were few people living out in this area.
  * **wild honey** - This honey was the natural product of bees in the wilderness; it was not cultivated by people. If that is what people would understand by the word "honey," you may not need to call it "wild."
  * **locusts** - These were large, hopping insects with wings, like very large grasshoppers. Some people who live in the desert eat them.
  * **camel hair** - A camel is an animal that has very rough hair. People could make clothing out of it. This could be translated as "rough animal hair."
  * **clothes made from camel hair** - That is, "coarse clothes made of camel hair." These clothes would not quickly wear out in the wilderness as other clothes would.
