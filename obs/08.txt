God had given Joseph the ability to interpret dreams, so Pharaoh had Joseph brought to him from the prison. Joseph interpreted the dreams for him and said, "God is going to send seven years of plentiful harvests, followed by seven years of famine."



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-08-08.jpg}}

Pharaoh was so impressed with Joseph that he appointed him to be the second most powerful man in all of Egypt!



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-08-09.jpg}}

Joseph told the people to store up large amounts of food during the seven years of good harvests. Then Joseph sold the food to the people when the seven years of famine came so they would have enough to eat.



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-08-10.jpg}}

The famine was severe not only in Egypt, but also in Canaan where Jacob and his family lived.



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-08-11.jpg}}

So Jacob sent his older sons to Egypt to buy food. The brothers did not recognize Joseph when they stood before him to buy food. But Joseph recognized them.



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-08-12.jpg}}

After testing his brothers to see if they had changed, Joseph said to them, "I am your brother, Joseph! Do not be afraid. You tried to do evil when you sold me as a slave, but God used the evil for good! Come and live in Egypt so I can provide for you and your families."



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-08-13.jpg}}

When Joseph's brothers returned home and told their father, Jacob, that Joseph was still alive, he was very happy.



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-08-14.jpg}}

Even though Jacob was an old man, he moved to Egypt with all of his family, and they all lived there. Before Jacob died, he blessed each of his sons.



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-08-15.jpg}}

The covenant promises that God gave to Abraham were passed on to Isaac, then to Jacob, and then to Jacob's twelve sons and their families. The descendants of the twelve sons became the twelve tribes of Israel.
